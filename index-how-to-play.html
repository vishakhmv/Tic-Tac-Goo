            This is a two-player game. One player plays with
            <span class="x">X</span> and the other plays with
            <span class="o">O</span>.
          </li>

          <li>
            The game always begins with <span class="x">X</span>. After that,
            <span class="o">O</span> takes the next turn.
          </li>

          <li>
            Players take turns clicking any empty box to place their symbol.
          </li>

          <li>
            The first player to align three identical symbols in a straight line
            (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the match.
          </li>

          <li>
            Only the <strong>last 6 moves</strong> remain visible on the board
            at all times.
          </li>

          <li>
            When the move limit is reached, the
            <strong>oldest active move</strong>
            turns red to show that it will be removed next.
          </li>

          <li>
            When a new move is played after this, the red (oldest) block is
            removed automatically from the board.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can press the <strong>Reset Game</strong> button at any time to
            start a fresh match.
          </li>

          <li>
            This is a two-player game. One player plays with
            <span class="x">X</span> and the other plays with
            <span class="o">O</span>.
          </li>

          <li>
            The game always starts with <span class="x">X</span>.
            <span class="o">O</span> plays second.
          </li>

          <li>The board is a <strong>5x5 grid</strong> (25 boxes).</li>

          <li>
            Players take turns clicking on an empty box to place their symbol.
          </li>

          <li>
            The first player to make three same symbols in a straight line
            (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
          </li>

          <li>
            Only the <strong>last 22 moves</strong> stay on the board at any
            time.
          </li>

          <li>
            When there are more than 21 moves, the
            <strong>oldest move turns red</strong>
            to show which block will be removed next.
          </li>

          <li>
            When a new move is made and the limit is crossed, the red (oldest)
            block is removed automatically from the board.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can click the <strong>Reset Game</strong> button anytime to
            start a new match.
          </li>
        </ol>
